## Data Source Permissions
This project pulls projection data from FantasyFootballAnalytics, usage metrics from NFLverse, and player metadata from Sleeper. All datasets are published publicly and allow non‑commercial reuse via their respective open licenses. No proprietary or paywalled information is collected.

## Predictive Limitations
The ranking engine is a basic points model driven by the public data above. It does not account for every factor that may influence real‑world performance. Unexpected injuries, coaching changes or other events can quickly render the projections inaccurate.

## Informational Use Only
The generated JSON files and any narrative summaries are provided for informational purposes. They should not be considered financial or gambling advice. Use the results at your own risk.
